                    Mistyping your password leads to failed logins and
                    time wasted. <a href="">Prior study</a> has shown <em>3% of
                    all users are prevented from logging in due to some simply
                    correctable typos, such as accidentally tapping on the
                    caps-lock key.</em> This is not only frustrating, but can also have a negative
                    effect on usersâ€™ security practices. Less secure (but easier to type) passwords
                    might seem more appealing, and users might be discouraged from locking their
                    computers.

                <p>
                    With this in mind, we built <b>TypTop</b>, a secure
                    personalized typo-tolerant password checker for your MAC or Linux
                    computer. It lets you focus on more important things than retyping

                    mistyping your password is annoying. Such typos can make

                    longer, more secure passwords are often harder to type and
                    you may not want to lock your computer as much.

                    TypTop offers typo-tolerance tailored to you. It
                    learns the typos that you make most frequently and allows you to log
                    in under a small handful of these typos. Security isn't
                    sacrificed. TypTop performs a number of safety checks before allowing
                    authentication under a given typo to ensure this will not degrade
                    security. We've conducted an in-depth analysis to prove that <span class="text-info">TypTop is
                    as secure as a conventional password-based authentication</span>.

                    <!-- TypTop learns from your past typing mistakes a policy of
                    what errors you are make often.
                    For future logins it will allow login under those errors.
                    Security isn't sacrificed:
                    TypTop only allows safe typos of your password, and we've
                    conducted an in-depth analysis to
                    prove that TypTop is as secure as conventional

                    Currently TypTop can be used in Unix based systems including
                    Mac OSX and Linux distributions.
                    We have precompiled packages for many systems. See if
                    you can find yours in <a
                        href="https://github.com/rchatterjee/TypTopcpp/releases">latest
                    releases.</a> The installation should be straightforward&#8212;download
                    the binary, click on it, and follow the
                    onscreen instructions.

                    Otherwise you can compile it in your machine from the source.
                    That's right: TypTop is open source software distributed under the MIT license.

                <p>
                    Once installed successfully, TypTop should register itself
                    with the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module">pluggable
                        authentication module (PAM)</a>, so
                    that it is invoked for all PAM based authentications requiring a password
                    to be typed.
                    It securely records typographical errors and enables login
                    with common
                    typos as it learns about them. If you are eager to check
                    whether
                    or not it is working, you can lock the screen and re-login
                    first with the correct
                    password, and then with a typo by adding '1' at the end of
                    your
                    password. For example, say your password is
                    <code>KuteCitten</code>, try to log in with
                    <code>KuteCitten1</code>. If you can login with the mistyped
                    password, then TypTop
                    is working fine!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can do the same experiment in the terminal with the
                    command 'su'; type <code>su $USER</code>,
                    in the terminal, type the correct password for the first
                    time, and next time try a typo of it
                    as described above.

                </div>
                <p>
                    TypTop is a new kind of a password checker that learns about
                    your old password
                    typing mistakes, and lets you login with the typos that you
                    frequently
                    make&#8212;if it is safe to do
                    so. We only allow typos that are very close to your
                    original password (i.e., off by one character) and that do
                    not degrade
                    unpredictability of the password by too great an amount. To
                    achieve this,
                    TypTop uses a new kind of encrypted cache to store recent
                    incorrect entries, and
                    unlocks these upon a correct entry of the password.
                    Incorrect entries that satisfy
                    TypTop's safety checks are then securely hashed and added to
                    a set of allowable
                    login passwords. On subsequent logins, TypTop not only
                    checks the original password,
                    but also checks against the entire set of allowed passwords.
                    If any match, then login
                    is allowed. All sensitive data (your password and typos of
                    it) are stored in secured
                    form on your system.

                <p>
                    TypTop is a research prototype and while our initial pilot
                    deployment has evidenced its
                    efficacy for users that make typos frequently, we need data
                    from a larger set of users
                    to understand what fraction of users benefit from TypTop's
                    design. We therefore have
                    built into TypTop an anonymized and secure feedback
                    mechanism, similar to how most modern
                    software reports back to the designers information useful
                    for improving the system.
                    There is absolutely no way to utilize the collected data to
                    learn about your
                    password or other sensitive information!
                </p>
                <h4>What data do we collect?</h4>

                <p> We do not record IP addresses or any other
                    information about the system from which an anonymous report
                    is collected. In fact we will not
                    even be able to associate data collected to individual
                    installations. <br/>

                    For each login we collect:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> The timestamp and local time of the login.</li>
                    <li> A unique identifier of the submitted password. The
                        identifier is obtained by computing an
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code">HMAC</a>
                        of the submitted password with a random 128-bit
                        secret unique to each installation of TypTop.
                        The 128-bit secret never leaves the user's computer.
                        Without the secret,
                        it is impossible to perform <a

                        or a character added to the end or beginning of the
                        original password, etc.).

                        The code is openly available in <a
                                href="https://github.com/rchatterjee/typtopcpp">GitHub</a>
                        and
                        you are more than welcome to review. Privacy and
                        security is our utmost
                        concern (that is what we do research on, after all!). We
                        have analyzed the design and
                        implementation of TypTop thoroughly including the data
                        that we collect. We are confident
                        that no one can learn any sensitive information from the
                        data that we collect or store.

                    <li><span
                            class="question">Really, allowing typos is secure?</span>
                        Yes! We have conducted significant analysis of the
                        TypTop design, which will be
                        released shortly in an academic paper. While the
                        analysis is a bit involved,
                        ultimately it boils down to the fact that guessing a
                        typo of your password is not
                        easier than guessing your password&#8212;as long as one
                        is careful about what counts
                        as a typo. That's why TypTop only allows safe
                        typos.<br/>

                        Moreover, allowing typos might encourage people to
                        choose longer and stronger
                        passwords, as entering them will no longer be as
                        cumbersome as it is now. Thus,
                        TypTop might actually improve security overall.
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="question">What kinds of typos are allowed in TypTop?</span>
                        TypTop only allows safe variants of your password.
                        First, a typo can only differ by a single
                        character. For example, <code>Kutecitten</code> versus
                        the real password <code>KuteCitten</code>.
                        Second, we ensure that a typo does not collide with an
                        easy-to-guess password, by ruling out
                        typos
                        that have low scores on state-of-the-art industry
                        strength meters (we use <a
                                href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn">
                            Dropbox's zxcvbn</a>). Third, we make sure that a
                        typo does not degrade the guessability of your real
                        password, again by ensuring that the drop in score under
                        a strength meter is not too large.
                        For example, if your real password is
                        <code>Pa%ssword</code>, then <code>Password</code>
                        is not an allowed typo, as the later is much easier to
                        guess than the former. These
                        restrictions,
                        taken together, ensure that typos will not be much
                        easier to guess than your actual password.

                        <!--The definition of typos in our setting is the passwords that are very close-->
                        <!--to your password, but not exactly the same. For example, <code>kuteCitten</code>-->
                        <!--can be typo of <code>KuteCitten</code>. <br/>We also make sure that a typo should-->
                        <!--not be much easier to guess than the real password. For example, if your real password is-->
                        <!--<code>Pa%ssword</code>, then <code>Password</code> is not an allowed typo, as-->
                        <!--the later is much easier to guess than the former.-->
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="question">Can someone train TypTop to allow any password?</span>
                        No. As just mentioned, we restrict typos to be close
                        variants of your true password.
                        <!--Unfortunately NOT! :-)<br/>-->
                        <!--First of all the allowed typo has to be very close to your-->
                        <!--original password (not to a typo), and <a-->
                        <!--href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength">the strength</a> of-->
                        <!--the typo must not be much less than that of the real password. <br/> Also,-->
                        <!--only the legitimate user can alter the cache of TypTop, as a typo is accepted-->
                        <!--in the cache only after the user logs in successfully.-->
                    </li>

                    <li><span class="question">What if your software is buggy, and I am locked out?</span>
                        We have tested TypTop on a variety of software and
                        hardware configurations. Even
                        if there are unexpected problems (please contact us if
                        so), you can go into recovery mode
                        and remove the line <code>auth include
                            typtop-auth</code> from all files in <code>/etc/pam.d</code>.
                        Alternatively, you can uninstall using the command
                        <code>sudo typtop --uninstall</code> in the
                        terminal in recovery mode.
                    </li>

                    <!-- li><span class="question">Can TypTop be hijacked/used to create backdoor in my computer?</span>
                        Security is our utmost concern, and hence, we have given
                        special attention to these issues.
                        Most of TypTop is written in Python, which decreases
                        probability of many security critical bugs.
                        We could not find any weakness in your design or
                        implementation. We are absolutely open to
                        suggestions and comments about TypTop. Please send them
                        to the email address given above.
